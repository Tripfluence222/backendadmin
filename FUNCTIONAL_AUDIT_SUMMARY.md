   ```bash
   # Install and start PostgreSQL
   # Create database: tripfluence_admin
   # Run migrations: npx prisma migrate deploy
   # Seed database: npx prisma db seed
   ```

2. **Configure Redis (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install and start Redis
   # Update REDIS_URL in .env file
   ```

3. **Update environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all required env vars are set
   # DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.
   ```

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Run full test suite after database setup**
   ```bash
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3005 npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **Test production build**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   npm run start:prod
   ```

3. **Verify all API endpoints**
   - Health check: `/api/healthz`
   - Customer management: `/api/customers`
   - Order management: `/api/orders`
