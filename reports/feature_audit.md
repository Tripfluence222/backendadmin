## Issues Fixed

### üîß Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. Next.js 15 Compatibility
**Issue:** API routes using old params syntax causing TypeScript errors
**Fix:** Updated 15+ API route handlers to use Promise-based params
```typescript
// Before
{ params }: { params: { id: string } }

// After  
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
const { id } = await params;
```
**Impact:** Eliminated 50+ TypeScript compilation errors

#### 2. Tailwind CSS Build Errors
**Issue:** Unknown utility class `border-border` causing build failures
**Fix:** Replaced problematic utilities with native CSS properties
```css
/* Before */
@apply border-border outline-ring/50;

/* After */
border-color: var(--color-border);
outline-color: var(--color-ring);
```
**Impact:** Build now compiles successfully

#### 3. Navigation Consistency Issues
**Issues Found:**
- Broken admin links (`/admin` ‚Üí `/dashboard`)
- Missing static pages (About, Contact, Privacy, Terms, Help)
- Inconsistent footer navigation
- Potential duplicate navigation components

**Fixes Applied:**
- Created centralized `FooterNav` component
- Implemented reusable `BackButton` component  
- Added all missing static pages with proper SEO
- Fixed all broken link references
- Updated public layout to use correct admin routes

#### 4. GitHub Workflow Syntax Error
**Issue:** Invalid comparison operator in Playwright workflow
**Fix:** Changed `===` to `==` for proper YAML syntax
```yaml
# Before
${{ matrix.project === 'desktop-chromium' && 'chromium' || 'webkit' }}

# After
${{ matrix.project == 'desktop-chromium' && 'chromium' || 'webkit' }}
```
